# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Architecture Overview

Diagbruit is a full-stack geospatial web application for noise impact diagnostics on buildings. It is a **monorepo** with independent components, each deployable separately.

```
Raw GeoData (shapefiles, GeoJSON; sourced from S3 / Box / data.gouv.fr)
    → dagster/   (orchestrator: ingestion → public_workspace.raw_* tables,
                  then dbt transforms raw_* → public schema; dbt lives in dagster/dbt)
    → fastapi/   (API: geometry intersection + scoring + recommendations)
    → frontend/  (React map: parcel selection → diagnostic results)
    → cms/       (Strapi: recommendation content management)
```

Ingestion and the dbt project both live under `dagster/` (there is no standalone
`ingestion/` component — the legacy `ingestion/launch-ingestion.sh` path was
removed in favour of Dagster assets).

All components share a single **PostgreSQL 15 + PostGIS 3.3** database. The `public_workspace` schema holds raw ingested data; the `public` schema holds dbt-transformed tables consumed by the API.

## Local Setup

```bash
# Start the database
docker-compose up -d

# Create all Python virtual environments
./setup-dev.sh
```

The dbt profile (`dagster/dbt/profiles.yml`) is committed and env-templated; it
defaults to the docker-compose DB, so no extra setup step is needed.

Local ports: frontend `:3000`, fastapi `:8000`, cms `:1337`, database `:5433`, dagster `:3001` (run `dagster dev -p 3001` to avoid conflict with frontend).
Default DB credentials: `user` / `password` / `diagbruit`.

## CI Pipeline

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on PRs and pushes to `main`/`preprod`:
1. Ingestion: `uv sync` in `dagster/` → `python ci_ingest.py ci_landing_by_codedept_job 033`
   (landing-only Dagster job: reads S3 `_source/` data + committed reference
   fixtures into `public_workspace.raw_*` / `geo_departements`). Needs the
   `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` repository secrets; no Box.
2. dbt: installs deps → `dbt run`
3. FastAPI: installs deps → `pytest --cov=app tests/`

A PostGIS service container is available throughout the pipeline.

## Deployment (Scalingo via GitHub Actions)

Deployments are automated via GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy-*.yml`). Each component auto-deploys to Scalingo when its files change:
- Push to `main` → deploys to production
- Push to `preprod` → deploys to preprod

Path filters ensure only the affected component is deployed (e.g. changes in `fastapi/**` trigger only the FastAPI deployment).

## Component CLAUDE.md Files

Each component has its own `CLAUDE.md` with commands and architecture details:
- `frontend/CLAUDE.md`
- `fastapi/CLAUDE.md`
- `dagster/CLAUDE.md`
- `dagster/dbt/CLAUDE.md`
- `poc-urbanisme-plu/CLAUDE.md` (branche `poc-urbanisme-plu` uniquement)
